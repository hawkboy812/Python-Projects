a=10
b=10

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)
print(b%3)# remainder .. this operator known as modulus
print(a**b)# is exponentiaion a.k.a in this case 10 root 10 (a root b) hence 10 multiplies itself 10 times
print(a//3)# floor division a.k.a in this case a is 10 and divided by 3 so remainder is not used instead the quotient is used
