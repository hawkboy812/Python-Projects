w='welcome123'
print(w.find('e',2))
print(w.index('e'))
#difference bw find and index is if u pass any value other than whats in the statement it will give error whereas find will give -1
print(w.isalpha())#for alphabets true or false
print(w.isdigit())#for numbers true or false

print(w.isalnum())#for both cases it will be true .. numbers as well as alphabets but false in case of special characters
